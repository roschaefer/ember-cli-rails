# Ruby support

According to [these release notes][latest-eol], Ruby versions prior to `2.1.x`
has been end-of-lifed.

Additionally, this codebase makes use of [(required) keyword arguments][kwargs].

From `ember-cli-rails@0.4.0` and on, we will no longer support versions of Ruby
prior to `2.1.0`.

`ember-cli-rails@0.8.0` adds support for Rails 5, which depends on `rack@2.0.x`,
which **requires** Ruby `2.2.2` or greater.

From `ember-cli-rails@0.8.0` and on, we will no longer support versions of Ruby
prior to `2.2.2`.

To use `ember-cli-rails` with older versions of Ruby, try the `0.3.x` series.
